# Suspecting Paraphraser ü¶é  + ‚å®Ô∏è ‚Üí üêç
This paraphraser transforms a yes/no question into a subjunctive one, which helps to add more question specific informality to the dataset. 

Example: "Did the American National Shipment company really break its own fleet?" -> "The American National Shipment company really broke its own fleet, didn't it?"

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a paraphraser and makes lexical substitutions.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This transformation would benefit tasks that are focused on conversational question answering.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The pronouns used in the endings aren't always on point - mostly because of ambiguity. As such, this transformation shouldn't be used for tasks that require their correctness.
