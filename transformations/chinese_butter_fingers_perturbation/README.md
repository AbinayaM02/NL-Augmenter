# Chinese Pinyin Butter Fingers Perturbation ü¶é  + ‚å®Ô∏è ‚Üí üêç
This perturbation adds noise to all types of text sources containing Chinese characters (sentence, paragraph, etc.) proportional to noise erupting 
from keyboard typos making common errors resulting from Chinese characters that have similiar Pinyin.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation to test robustness. Few letters picked at random are replaced with letters 
which are at keyboard positions near the source letter. Generated transformations display high similarity to the 
source sentences i.e. the code outputs highly precise generations. 

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document with Chinese characters as input like text classification, 
text generation, etc.

## Previous Work
1) Butter Finger implementation borrowed from this code https://github.com/alexyorke/butter-fingers

2) There has also been some recent work in the contrast sets of the GEM Benchmark (ACL 2021):

  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}
}
```

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation's outputs are too simple to be used for data augmentation. Unlike a paraphraser, it is not capable of
 generating linguistically diverse text.
