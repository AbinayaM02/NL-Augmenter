# Sentence additions
This perturbation adds generated sentence to all types of text sources (sentence, paragraph, etc.) by passing the input text to a GPT-2 Text Generation model.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation will take in an input text and generate additional sentences to perturbe the inputs that have been show by Jia and Liang, 2017 to be impact model performance. This can be used to test model robustness. 

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks on text classification and generation. 

Benchmark results:

- Sentiment analysis: we run sentiment analysis on a 1% sample of the IMDB dataset. The original accuracy is 956 and the perturbed accuracy is 95.2.
- Text summarization: we run text summarization on a 1% sample of the xsum dataset. The original BLEU is 15.99 and the perturbed BLEU is 9.75.

This is uses ideas that are related to the AddSent and AddOneSent adversarial examples covered in this EMNLP 2017 paper:

The GPT-2 text generation model is from the following paper:

  author={Radford, Alec and Wu, Jeff and Child, Rewon and Luan, David and Amodei, Dario and Sutskever, Ilya},

```

We use its implementation from huggingface (https://huggingface.co/gpt2).

## What are the limitations of this transformation?

This transformation will only change the input text that has more than one sentence.
