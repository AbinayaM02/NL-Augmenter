### What type of Transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation to test robustness. Generated transformations display high similarity to the source sentence's semantics. i.e. the code outputs highly precise 
generations.

### What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text generations, text classification etc.

### What are the limitations of this transformation?
A rule-based transformation, could be slightly incorrect in grammar. (could act as additional noise in the transformation)
