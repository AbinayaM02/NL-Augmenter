# Antonyms Substitute
This transformation aims to substitute words with their antonyms, which facilitates the diversity of the content.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation could introduce semantic diversity by adding antonyms. Specifically, it will help revert the semantics to an opposite position or uses double negation to express the similar semantics. In general, we assume that an even number of transforms will remain the semantics in terms of sentiment; however, an odd number of transforms will revert the semantics. 


## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This augmentation would benefit tasks related to sentiment analysis, contrastive learning and classification, by augmenting the dataset. The preserance of the labels would be dependent to the number of transforms that were applied in given text.

Benchmark results:

Sentiment analysis: we run sentiment analysis on a 1% sample of the IMDB dataset. The original accuracy is 96.0 and the perturbed accuracy is 89.0.

The antonyms are based on WordNet via NLTK

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
Since the antonyms are generated using WordNet, it would have limitation to augment issues, such as making the text non-grammarly correct.
