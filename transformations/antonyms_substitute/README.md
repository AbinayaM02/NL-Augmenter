# Antonyms Substitute (Double Negation)  ü¶é  + ‚å®Ô∏è ‚Üí üêç
This transformation aims to substitute even number of words with their antonyms which would increase the diversity of the given content. Its double negation mechanism does not revert original sentence semantics.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation introduces semantic diversity by replacing even number of adjective/adverb antonyms in given text. We assume that an even number of transforms will remain the semantics in terms of sentiment; however, an odd number of transforms will revert the semantics. Thus, it only applies to the sentence that the number of revertable adjective or adverb in the given sentence is even. We called it double negation.

    
## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This augmentation would benefit tasks related to sentiment analysis by augmenting the dataset. The labels for generated sentences would be the semantically similar to their previous one as the double negation mechanism does not change original sentence semantics.

The following code was used for the evaluation.

```
python evaluate.py -t AntonymsSubstitute -task "TEXT_CLASSIFICATION" -m "aychang/roberta-base-imdb" -d "imdb"
python evaluate.py -t AntonymsSubstitute -task "TEXT_CLASSIFICATION" -m "textattack/bert-base-uncased-QQP" -d "qqp"
python evaluate.py -t AntonymsSubstitute -task "TEXT_CLASSIFICATION" -m "textattack/roberta-base-SST-2" -d "sst2"

The antonyms are based on WordNet via NLTK

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
Since the antonyms are generated using WordNet, it would have limitation to augment issues, such as making the text non-grammarly correct.
